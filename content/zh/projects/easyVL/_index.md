## Digital Logic Simulator

### Overview
The goal is to build a digital logic simulator that is able to simulate non-trivial digital systems including a central processing unit (CPU).

### Logic Simulation with the EasyVL Language
Our simulator simulates digital logics specified as synchronous circuits. A synchronous circuit is made up of inputs/outputs, wires, logic gates like and/or/not, and flip-flops driven by a single clock signal. It represents a finite state machine (FSM) where the current state is the boolean values stored in the flip-flops and and there is exactly one state transition per clock cycle. For each clock cycle, the next state and the current outputs are computed from the current inputs and the current state using the wires and the logic gates. Therefore, one of the tasks of our simulator, named logic simulation, is to determine the current inputs and the current state and to compute the current outputs and the next state repeatedly.

Given that hardware designers may use our simulator to simulate many different synchronous circuits, we should allow them to specify the circuits in a way that is convenient and familiar to them. While there are many establish tools including schematic drawing programs and hardware description languages, it is extremely diffcult for us to build one because of our limited knowledge on both digital logic simulation and C++. Therefore, we decide to design our own language called EasyVL for the designers to specify the circuits in a textual form by simplifying one of the most popular hardware description languages called Verilog and adding a few extensions. Though EasyVL is relatively simple, it is powerful enough so we can simulate any synchronous circuit once it is specified in EasyVL.
