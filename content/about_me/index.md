## My experience

### About my work
I am currently a data scientist at Amazon. Previously, I worked at Uptake, an IoT SaaS company, the Chicago police department, and medical imaging research center at Illinois Institute of Technology, with the focuses on the application of statistics, machine learning and pattern recognition in academic research and industry work. Please refer to my resume.

### About data science
Although my role is a data scientist, I prefer being called a statistician or even economics in order to distinguish from a software engineering who is specialized in machine learning. Also, in my opinion, technically speaking, data science is not science as it has neither established an axiomatic system nor developed a mature methodology. Essentially, it is not that much different from, for instance, Physics, in terms of modeling methodology. It is more like an extension of many traditional areas. Specifically, it leaves the complex problems that are either high dimensional or too difficult to be tackled via experiments and inference by human intelligence, to be handled by statistical learning models fitting the data, and eventually simplifies the problems for further inference or prediction (This claim might not be held true due to the fast evolving self-learning AI in recent year).

I used to study engineering in school and happened to have a chance to do research for a social science topic. When I was doing literature review, I noticed that often for one concept, people with different academic backgrounds tend to interpret it in different ways. For example, there is an intersection in stochastic process where people doing signal processing, control theory, economics, or even physics share similar interests. They study it from different point of views despite the same essence.  Nevertheless, these multiple viewpoints made me have deeper understandings of many concepts. And I really enjoy that Aha moment. You can’t see the forest for the trees! That’s why, in my spare time, I like watching videos by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) (a YouTube channel created by Grant Sanderson). It focuses on higher mathematics and physics with a distinct visual perspective.

In my professional life, I also like to leverage all kinds of models or tools to help people who are not experts in a certain area understand a problem in a way that they are comfortable with, which I think is one of the highlights of data science: extract the signal from the noise, then translate it into actionable insights. Please refer to my expertise.


## What I do in my spare time

### Music
I have a wide range of interests (not master in most of them though :( ). I used to play piano for about 7 years when I was a kid. But since I was 14 years old, I had not touched it again for 15 years until about 5 years ago I decided to pick up this rusty skill. I am also learning to play ukulele. I love classical music, especially those works in late Classical period and Romantic era. My favorite works include Beethoven’s Sonata No. 8 Op. 13 (Pathetique) and violin concerto in D major, Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No.1 and Violin Concerto in D major. I believe the magic of art is to arouse sympathy. Maybe the reason why I love these masterpieces is because I strongly feel the connections when I listen to them.

### Travel and photography
I am fascinated with hiking and exploring the outdoors. Since I'm interested in history, when I go to a historical site that plays an importance role in human civilization, I always get emotional. Breathtaking nature sceneries and cultural heritage sites make me feel humble and realize how insignificant I am in front of Mother Nature and long history. Of course, I have taken tons of photos for those places that I have visited. Photography is one of my hobbies.

### Literature and history
In my spare time, I like reading Chinese literature books, some of which are the ones that I used to read when I was young but were not fully digested. I’m particular interested in [the Hundred Schools of Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought) during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period of ancient China, [Tang poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_poetry), [the Ci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ci_(poetry)) (a type of lyric poetry), [the Qu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu_(poetry) (another type of classical Chinese poetry form), and novels in Ming and Qing dynasty. My favorites include: [Records of the Grand Historian (a.k.a Shiji)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Grand_Historian), poems by [Li Bai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Bai), [Su Shi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi) and (Cao Cao)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Cao], [the Four Classic Novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Chinese_Novels)(Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, Water Margin and Dream of the Red Chamber), [Fortress Besieged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_Besieged) by Qian Zhongshu, and [Thunderstorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm_(play)) by Cao Yu. Other than literature, I am also into history and military. I spend lots of time studying literature, historical documents, and video productions for periods such as [Eastern Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Zhou), [the Chu–Han Contention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu%E2%80%93Han_Contention), [the Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms), the history of Europe post-18th century.
